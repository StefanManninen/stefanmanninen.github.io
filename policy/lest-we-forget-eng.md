# Privacy Policy for Lest We Forget

This privacy policy describes how **Lest We Forget** (“the App”), developed by **Stefan Manninen**, collects, uses, and protects your information.

---

## 1. What Information Is Collected?

- **Entry data**  
  The app collects and stores the notes you save, including title, content, tags, and timestamps for when the entry was created and last modified.

- **Authentication data (if you log in)**  
  If you choose to log in with your Google account for cloud sync, we receive access to your:
  - Email address  
  - Display name  
  - Profile picture URL  
  - Firebase user ID (UID)

  > **Note**: We never access your Google password.

- **Cloud sync data**  
  If logged in, your entries are synced to a private and secure section of your Firebase Firestore database, tied to your UID.

---

## 2. How Is the Information Used?

- **To provide core features**  
  Your entries are stored locally on your device so you can browse and manage them within the app.

- **For cloud sync**  
  Authentication information is used to verify your identity and sync your data securely across devices via Firebase Firestore.

- **To improve the app**  
  Anonymous, aggregated data may be used to understand how the app is used and to improve features and user experience.

---

## 3. How Is Your Information Protected?

- **Cloud data protection**  
  All synced data is stored securely in Google Firebase Firestore with encryption and strict access control. Only you can access your data when logged in.

- **Local data protection**  
  Data is stored on your device using an internal SQLite database, which is private to the app.

- **No third-party sharing**  
  We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing or analytics.

- **Limited backend access**  
  Only the developer, **Stefan Manninen**, has limited access to the cloud backend for maintenance and debugging — under strict security measures.

---

## 4. Your Choices and Rights

- **Login is optional**  
  The app can be used fully without logging in. Cloud sync is optional.

- **Delete your data**  
  You can delete entries at any time. If logged in, deletions are synced to Firebase as well. If you delete your Google account, your cloud data will also be removed.

- **Contact**  
  For questions or to request access or deletion of your data, email: [app@stefanmanninen.se](mailto:app@stefanmanninen.se)
